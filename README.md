# Finite Field Arithmetic

A simple Python module for performing finite field arithmetic.

![GIF demo](media/demo.gif)

## Usage
This module implements three algebraic elements:
* Fields
* Polynomials
* Field elements

In order to load the module simple import it:
```python
from finite_field_arith import *
```

### Fields

The general syntax for creating a field is:

```python
F = Field(p, dim, irr)
```

Where $p$ is some prime, $dim \geq 1$. If $dim > 1$ then $irr$ is an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$ of degree $n$.

For example, to construct $\mathbb{F}_2$:
```python
F2 = Field(2, 1, None)
```

Given an irreducible polynomial of degree $3$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$, say $irr = x^3 + x + 1$ one can construct $\mathbb{F}_8$ simply by calling:

```python
F8 = Field(2, 3, irr)
```
### Polynomials
A polynomial $f$ of degree $k$ is determined by:
* Its underlying field $\mathbb{F}$
* Its list of coefficients $\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_k \in \mathbb{F}$

Given a field $F$ and a list of coefficients $coefs$ from list we can construct the polynomial:
```python
f = Polynomial(coefs, F)
```
### Field Elements
A field element $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}$ is determined by the polynomial representation of $\alpha$ and its underlying field $\mathbb{F}$. Note that since the polynomial representation of $\alpha$ already encapsulates $\mathbb{F}$ the construction of $\alpha$ is dependent on the polynomial alone. 

That is, if $f$ is a polynomial in some field $F$ then:
```python
alpha = Element(f)
```
Constructs the appropriate field element $f \textrm{ mod } F.irr$

### Full example
The following snippet constructs $\mathbb{F}_2, \mathbb{F}_8\cong \mathbb{F}_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x + 1\rangle, f=1+x^2$ and the field element $\alpha_f = 1 + x^2 \mod x^3 + x + 1$:
```python
F2 = Field(2, 1, None)
irr = Polynomial([1, 1, 0, 1], F2)
F8 = Field(2, 3, irr)
f = Polynomial([1, 0, 1], F8)
f_in_field = Element(f)
```

## Functionality
In what follows, let $F$ be a field, $f,g,h$ polynomials and $a,b$ field elements. Things you can do with this module include:

### Polynomial arithmetic:
 ```python
t = f * g #product
t = f + g #addition (and subtraction)
t = f / g #quotient 
t = f % g #remainder
```

### Field operations:
```python
a_gen = a.generated_subgroup() #set of elements generated by powers of a
g = Element.draw_generator(F, halt = k) #draw random element in F and return it if it generates the entire field. Give up after k attempts (by default halt is unbounded)
```
